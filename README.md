# Advent of Code Solutions, 2021

[Advent of Code Site](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

All solutions written in Racket.

Each day has two parts, and each of my files has two `(module+ main ...)` expressions. 
In all files, the first is commented out. To run part 1 instead of part 2, change which main expression is disabled.

In all cases, you should  be able to run the problem input by running the files in DrRacket, or on the command line.

```
$ <cat, echo, etc input data> | racket day<#>.rkt
```

The one exception so far is [day 18](day18.rkt), where my code expects all commas in the input file to be replaced with spaces.
